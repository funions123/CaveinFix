CaveinFix

This mod fixes certain balance problems with the (currently half-baked and unfinished) optional cave-ins mechanic in vintage story.

FEATURES:

-Unstable blocks (IE: rock, cracked rock, ore) will cap their instability at the stability of the block below them. This means, if a more unstable block is above a more stable rock, there won't be cave-ins caused by blocks the player cannot see (assuming the stable block is the visible ceiling).

-During world generation, naturally generated caves and overhangs will generate a layer of "hardened rock" that prevents caves and overhangs from being inherently extremely unstable, especially caves in sedimentary rock. If you've ever played terrafirmacraft 1.20+, this is pretty much the same mechanic as is implemented there.

-Includes a config option to globally scale the instability of collapsible rocks: 0.5 means every block is half as unstable, 2.0 means every block is twice as unstable, etc.
